# DevMine
The new mcpe software that does not use pm code base! 

# Why is it called DevMine?
Simply because you need to understand php in order to convert PocketMine plugins into DevMine plugins!

# Why would you completely change the code base?
It allows for much better organization.

# What is DevMine's folder structure?
DevMine's folder structure is basically the ImagicalMine project (https://github.com/Inactive-to-Reactive/ImagicalMine) with a different folder structure! Everything else is basically the same. Also, a few additional features were added in, that were originally from plugins. Have fun using it! It is expected to be in the beta stage by mid-August 2016 at the max, if not late July 2016.
