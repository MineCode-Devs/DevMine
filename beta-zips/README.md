# BETA-ZIPS
Here, zips will be uploaded during the unstable beta builds.
For each zip, there will be a different problem that @remotevase was not able to locally solve. 
He wants @AmiroEmad or @Taki21 to help figure it out.
B1: You can see the problem as soon as you enter "eng" into the installer when you start it up.
